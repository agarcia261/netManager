# netManager

### Overview
NetManager is a tool that allows NOC engineers to troubleshoot an Internet Service Provider Core's network.
The app will interface with the routers of an Internet Service Providerâ€™s backbone and will allow the network engineers to quickly get the status of the customer inter-connection visually.  The application will be able to retrieve customer information independently of the vendor.  The App will aggregate information from different layers of the internet protocol stack

NetManager will expedite troubleshooting by aggregating all relevant information on a single place. This will save time and cost of training by providing an intuitive graphical vendor-neutral interface to the network.

The app is deloyed on [Heroku](https://columbia-netmanager.herokuapp.com)
